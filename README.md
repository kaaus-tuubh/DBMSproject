### Student Achievement Record in jsp

In this project we are creating one application which is easy to access user friendly for the students to complete the record of the achievements.

For this application we used the backend as MySql to store the data which is used in the application and for the user interface we had used the JSP and HTML5.
Students and the teacher as well can use the application.
The student is able to fill all the details of the achievement very easily from any place and can upload the certificate regarding the details of achievement.
The teacher is the only person who is able to view achievements of any particular student and download the certificates and student achievements from the site.
